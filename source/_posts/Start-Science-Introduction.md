## Journey of the Farmboy
![](/images/farmboy.gif)
I grew up on a small farm in the middle of Kansas. My father had built a respectable farm where we harvested wheat, and raised cattle. From the age of 10 I was already driving tractors, working the fields, and raising my own cattle that my parents had purchased for me from my farm earnings. Looking back this was a huge break for me as that money ended up paying for my entire 4 year degree.

Being the youngest of 4 I always strived to stand out on my own, and when I started high school some friends got me into computers and gaming. I started building a few computers for myself and other family members and fell in love with technology. Entering college I knew that I wanted to focus on technology in some way but wasn't sure where. I ended up honing in on a computer networking degree, but took some web development classes and fell down a rabbit hole of html, css, and javascript.
